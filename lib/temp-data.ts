All light cables were home runs back to approx. 12 control chambers that sit on the roof of the Aotea Centre, this was a challenge as the panels required to be non visible when stood in front of the Aotea Centre. All works and the full installation was outside, so everything had to be perfect and suitable for the outdoor conditions. The Client was very happy with the final results, the colour changing LEDS illuminate/feature most nights outside of the Aotea Centre.",
